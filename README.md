## Project Overview
This project is an interactive data dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel to analyze customer purchasing behavior for a bike retail business. The dashboard transforms raw data into meaningful insights, helping to identify key sales drivers across different customer demographics such as income, region, and age.
## Key Features
- Dynamic Slicers: Features interactive filtering tools for Marital Status, Region (Europe, North America, Pacific), and Education levels, allowing for real-time data exploration.
- Average Income Analysis: A clustered bar chart comparing the average income per purchase between male and female customers to identify high-value segments.
- Customer Age Segmentation: A line chart visualizing purchase trends across three main age brackets: Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old.
- Geographic Performance: Insights into regional sales distribution to understand which markets are performing best.
## Data Analysis Workflow
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized category names (e.g., age brackets and regions).
- Pivot Tables: Summarized thousands of rows of raw data into structured tables for visualization.
- Dashboard Design: Applied a dark-themed professional layout with synchronized charts and slicers for a seamless user experience.
